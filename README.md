# Svelte Toolbox

A UI component library for Svelte implementing Google's Material Design specification.

Beacuse Svelte Toolbox is early in development, some things may change before we hit `v1.0.0`.

## Inspiration

As I was working on an app using [Sapper](http://sapper.dev), I was made made aware of the fact that if there was a UI component library out there for [Svelte](http://svelte.dev), it would make developing a Svelte app so much easier!

I am a big fan of the Google Material Design patterns, and because I really like [React Toolbox](https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox), I decided to make something like it for Svelte.
